This project implements a transformer-based model using RoBERTa-bne (PlanTL-GOB-ES) for the automatic detection of cyberbullying in Spanish-language social media content. It includes a series of Python scripts and data files that collectively prepare, tokenize, train, and evaluate the model. The model.py script serves as the core component, orchestrating a 5-fold stratified cross-validation training loop, applying Hugging Faceâ€™s Trainer API, and saving detailed metrics at each epoch. Supporting scripts include prepare_dataset.py, which filters and loads the original dataset (es_hf_102024.csv), and prepare_tokenized_data.py, which applies RoBERTa tokenization and prepares the Hugging Face Dataset for training.
